This MoU expired two years ago, and as a result, Indian students have not been able to receive nominations for this prestigious scholarship program.%0A%0A` +
                       `I have contacted the University Grants Commission (UGC), and they have informed me that if students highlight this issue, the Ministry of Education can take immediate action to renew the MoU. However, despite multiple efforts, no progress has been made so far.%0A%0A` +
